# Install

Run 
`npm i @push-based/user-flow --save-dev` or `yarn add @push-based/user-flow --dev` 
to install the library.  
  
After that you can run:  
`user-flow --help`or `user-flow --help`  

## Run without install
You can also use `npx` to run it in e.g. the CI setup:
`npx @push-based/user-flow --help`
 
# Quick Start

In this quick start we can read about 2 common things, using the package in an existing project and using it in a fresh project.
Both ways require a node and npm project setup to install user-flow and folders to store the reports and test files.

0. have node [v14.X.X](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed  
run `node -v` and `npm -v` to check it.  

## Set up and run user flows in an existing project

In this chapter we will learn how to install and configure user flows, as well as create a first example test and see the resulting performance report.  

0. Install:

```bash
npm i @push-based/user-flow --save-dev
```

1. Set up the `.user-flowrc.json` config file

Run 
```
npx @push-based/user-flow init
```  

or if you already installed it,

```
npx user-flow init
```  

in the console and accept the default value for every question.

![Set up user-flow in existing project gif](./docs/images/setup-in-existing-project.gif)

This results in the following file:

_./.user-flowrc.json_
```json
{
  "collect": {
    "url": "https://coffee-cart.netlify.app/",
    "ufPath": "./user-flows"
  },
  "persist": { "outPath": "./measures", "format": ["html"] }
}
```

2. The CLI automatically creates an example user-flow. (`./user-flows/order-coffee.uf.ts`) 

It is a simple navigation measurement to start from.

_./order-coffee.uf.ts_
```typescript
import {
  UserFlowInteractionsFn,
  UserFlowContext,
  UserFlowProvider
} from '@push-based/user-flow';

// Your custom interactions with the page 
const interactions: UserFlowInteractionsFn = async (ctx: UserFlowContext): Promise<any> => {
  const { page, flow, browser, collectOptions } = ctx;
  const { url } = collectOptions;

  // Navigate to coffee order site
  await flow.navigate(url, {
    stepName: 'Navigate to coffee cart',
  });

  // Select coffee

  // Checkout order

  // Submit order

};

const userFlowProvider: UserFlowProvider = {
  flowOptions: {name: 'Order Coffee'},
  interactions
};

module.exports = userFlowProvider;
```

3. Run CLI
You can directly run the cli command. The typescript files will get resolved and compiled live. 

`npx user-flow collect` or just `npx user-flow` as collect is the default.

This will execute the user flow and opens the HTML report in the browser:

<img width="960" alt="getting-started-resulting-navigation-report" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10064416/168185483-c6ca499e-a8a6-40b7-b450-448de8784454.PNG">


For more information on how to write user-flows read in the [Writing user flows for the CLI](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/writing-basic-user-flows.md) section.

Optionally you can pass params to overwrite the values form `.user-flowrc.ts` in the file directly or over the CLI:

```bash
npx user-flow --ufPath=./user-flows-new --outPath=./user-flows-reports --url=https://localhost:4200
```
  
> **ü§ì DX Tip:**  
> For a faster development process you can use the `--dryRun` option to skip measurement and perform the interactions only  
> This is a multitude faster e.g. **3s** vs **53s** for a simple 2 step flow with navigation  

## Set up an empty project (optionally)

If you don't want to maintain your user flows in the same repository the following steps describe how to setup a new project.
You can skip this steps and go directly to the setup below. 

0. Create a new folder e.g. `user-flow-demo` for the user flows and initialize npm: `npm init`  

run 
```
npm version
```  

to check it.   
You should see `'user-flow-demo': '1.0.0',` as first line.

Make sure you have the CLI installed:
```bash
npm i @push-based/user-flow --save-dev
```
now you can run it directly with `user-flow`. Test it:

```bash
npx user-flow --version
```

# CLI

## Prompts and interaction

We provide general interaction through the keyboard or `stdin` directly for testing and other crazy hacks.

### Multiselect choices

 These key combinations can be used on _multiple_ choice prompts.For more details see [enquirer - multiselect](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer/blob/master/docs/prompts/multiselect.md)

 | **command**       | **description**                                                                                                      |
 | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
 | <kbd>space</kbd>  | Toggle the currently selected choice when `options.multiple` is true.                                                |
 | <kbd>number</kbd> | Move the pointer to the choice at the given index. Also toggles the selected choice when `options.multiple` is true. |
 | <kbd>a</kbd>      | Toggle all choices to be enabled or disabled.                                                                        |
 | <kbd>i</kbd>      | Invert the current selection of choices.                                                                             |
 | <kbd>g</kbd>      | Toggle the current choice group.                                                                                     |

### Multiple choices in the CLI  

To assign multiple choices to a multiselect CLI param you have to use the param multiple times.

e.g. to select multiple formats for the collect output write:  

```text
@npx @push-based/user-flow collect -f=md -f=json
```

## Commands 

> **üí° Pro Tip:**
> CLI arguments that accept multiple values can be set by using the param multiple times in a row:
>
> As an example we could apply two different formats as output for the `collect` command:
> `npx user-flow collect --format=json --format=md`

### `*` command

Run the default command over:  
`@npx @push-based/user-flow [options]`  

Description:  
The default command forwards all options to the [`collect`](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/tree/main/packages/cli#collect-command).

### `init` command

Run command over:  
`@npx @push-based/user-flow init [options]`  

Description:  
This command helps you to set up a `.user-flowrc.json` and asks for input over CLI prompts.

> **ü§ì DX Tip:** 
> Set up user flows in a sub directory:  
> `npx @push-based/user-flow init --rcPath ./path/to/project/.user-flowrc.json`

### `collect` command

Run command over:  
`@npx @push-based/user-flow collect [options]`  or `@npx @push-based/user-flow [options]` as it is the default command.  

Description:  
This command executes a set of user-flow definitions against the target URL and saves the output.

|  Option                            |  Type     | Default                |  Description                                                                                               |  
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  
| **`--url`**, **`-t`**              | `string`  | n/a                    | URL to analyze                                                                                             |  
| **`--ufPath`**, **`-u`**           | `string`  | `./user-flows`         | folder containing user-flow files to run. (`*.uf.ts` or`*.uf.js`)                                          |  
| **`--outPath`**, **`-o`**          | `string`  | `./measures`           | output folder for the user-flow reports                                                                    |  
| **`--serveCommand`**, **`-s`**     | `string`  | n/a                    | Runs a npm script to serve the target app. This has to be used in combination with `--awaitServeStdout`    |  
| **`--awaitServeStdout`**, **`-a`** | `string`  | `.user-flowrc` setting | Waits for stdout from the serve command to start collecting user-flows                                     |  
| **`--format`**, **`-f`**           | `string`  | `html`, `json` setting | Format of the creates reports                                                                              |  
| **`--openReport`**, **`-e`**       | `boolean` | `true`                 | Opens browser automatically after the user-flow is captured                                                |  
| **`--budget-path`**, **`-b`**      | `string`  | `./budget.json`        | Path to the lighthouse `budget.json` file                                                                  |  

## Report Formats and Viewer

You can either export the report as `HTML` or `JSON` format. The html file can be opened in any browser.

Use the `.user-flowrc.json` property `persist.format` and give an array as value. e.g. `['html']` or `['html', 'json']`.

You can also use the CLI option `--format` to choose a format.  

- single format: `@push-based/user-flow collect --format html`  
- multiple formats: `@push-based/user-flow collect --format html --format json`  

> **ü§ì DX Tip:**  
> For a faster development process you can use the `--openReport` or `-e` option to automatically open the report in the browser.
> The CLI will serve either the HTML report or opens the lighthouse report viewer if only a JSON format is available and displays it there.
> e.g. `@push-based/user-flow collect --openReport`   

The json file can be drag & dropped into the [lighthouse viewer](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/). 
This format is very good for programmatic processing and foundation for most of the features of this lib. 
![Lighthouse Viewer - File drop area](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10064416/168185615-3ed66255-5287-4de3-a32a-cb9b053589de.PNG)

## Configuration

The CLI supports the official [user-flow/lighthouse configuration](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/configuration.md). 

# Writing user flows for the CLI

You can think of user flows as front end e2e tests which measures performance related information during the test.

## [Advanced architecture](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/ufo-architecture.md)

Organizing testing logic is an art. If you don't own that knowledge, the amount of low-level code get's a night mare to maintain in bigger projects...

**This is the reason we introduced UFO's!**
**Organize clutter code üëΩ in developer friendly shells üõ∏**

See [ufo-architecture](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/ufo-architecture.md) for more details.

## [Working with DevTools Recorder exports](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/recorder-exports.md)

Chrome DevTools provides a feature to help with record and exoprt user interations. 
This can replace any handwritten code and organizes interactions in a JSON structure.
![User Flow-record-replay](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10064416/197055275-f2b59528-105d-494d-8285-5d29fe89d0bd.jpg)
This library provides a way to replay and enrich those interactions over the CLI.

See [recorder-exports](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/recorder-exports.md) for more details.

## [Performance Budgets](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/performance-budgets.md)

Implementing performance improvements without breaking something is hard.  
**Even harder is it, to keep it that way. üîí**

![img-budgets-mode-support](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10064416/164581870-3534f8b0-b7c1-4252-9f44-f07febaa7359.PNG)

See [performance-budgets](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/performance-budgets.md) for more details.

## Debugging

`@push-based/user-flow` ships with small helpers for logging and debugging.

### `logVerbose`

A function that logs the passed string only if the CIL options `--verbose` or `-v`is true. 

**Usage**

_./order-coffee.uf.ts_
```typescript
import { logVerbose } from "@push-based/user-flow";
// ...

logVerbose('test'); 
```

`npx user-flow collect` logs nothing  
`npx user-flow collect --verbose` logs "test"
