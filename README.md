# Install

Run 
`npm i @push-based/user-flow --save-dev` or `yarn add @push-based/user-flow --dev` 
to install the library.  
  
After that you can run:  
`user-flow --help`or `user-flow --help`  

## Run without install
You can also use `npx` to run it in e.g. the CI setup:
`npx @push-based/user-flow --help`
 
# Quick Start

As the CLI needs a npm project to run in we explain 2 common things, using the package in an existing project and using it in a fresh project.
Both ways require a node and npm project setup to install user-flow and folders to store the reports and test files.

0. have node [v14.X.X](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed  
run `node -v` and `npm -v` to check it.  

To start from scratch read [setup an empty project](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/general-cli-features.md)

## Set up and run user flows in an existing npm project 

In this chapter we will learn how to install and configure user flows, as well as create a first example test and see the resulting performance report.  

0. Install:

```bash
npm i @push-based/user-flow --save-dev
```

1. Set up the `.user-flowrc.json` config file

Run 
```
npx @push-based/user-flow init
```  

or if you already installed it,

```
npx user-flow init
```  

in the console and accept the default value for every question.

![Set up user-flow in existing project gif](./docs/images/setup-in-existing-project.gif)

This results in the following file:

_./.user-flowrc.json_
```json
{
  "collect": {
    "url": "https://coffee-cart.netlify.app/",
    "ufPath": "./user-flows"
  },
  "persist": { "outPath": "./measures", "format": ["html"] }
}
```

2. The CLI automatically creates an example user-flow. (`./user-flows/basic-navigation.uf.ts`) 

It is a simple navigation measurement to start from.

_./basic-navigation.uf.ts_
```typescript
import {
  UserFlowInteractionsFn,
  UserFlowContext,
  UserFlowProvider
} from '@push-based/user-flow';

// Your custom interactions with the page 
const interactions: UserFlowInteractionsFn = async (ctx: UserFlowContext): Promise<any> => {
  const { page, flow, browser, collectOptions } = ctx;
  const { url } = collectOptions;

  // Navigate to URL
  await flow.navigate(url, {
    stepName: `Navigate to ${url}`,
  });

};

const userFlowProvider: UserFlowProvider = {
  flowOptions: {name: 'Order Coffee'},
  interactions
};

module.exports = userFlowProvider;
```

3. Run CLI
You can directly run the cli command. The typescript files will get resolved and compiled live. 

`npx user-flow collect` or just `npx user-flow` as collect is the default.

This will execute the user flow and opens the HTML report in the browser:

For more information on how to write user-flows read in the [Writing user flows for the CLI](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/writing-basic-user-flows.md) section.

Optionally you can pass params to overwrite the values form `.user-flowrc.ts` in the file directly or over the CLI:

```bash
npx user-flow --ufPath=./user-flows-new --outPath=./user-flows-reports --url=https://localhost:4200
```
  
> **ü§ì DX Tip:**  
> For a faster development process you can use the `--dryRun` option to skip measurement and perform the interactions only  
> This is a multitude faster e.g. **3s** vs **53s** for a simple 2 step flow with navigation  

# CLI
You can read more about tricks and DX the [general CLI features](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/general-cli-features.md) in our docs.

## Commands 

### `*` command

Run the default command over:  
`@npx @push-based/user-flow [options]`  

Description:  
The default command forwards all options to the [`collect`](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow#collect-command) command.

### [`init` command](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/command-init.md)

Run command over:  
`@npx @push-based/user-flow init [options]`  

Description:  
This command helps you to set up a `.user-flowrc.json` and asks for input over CLI prompts.

|  Option                            |  Type     | Default                | Description                                                                                              |  
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **`-h`**, **`--generateFlow`**     | `boolean` | n/a                    | Generate basic user-flow file under `ufPath`                                                             |    
| **`-g`**, **`--generateGhWorkflow`** | `boolean` | n/a                    | Generate `user-flow.yml` file under `.github/workflows`                                                             |

As a result we get a `.user-flowrc.json` and an example flow if answered with yes.

> **ü§ì DX Tip:** 
> Set up user flows in a sub directory:  
> `npx @push-based/user-flow init --rcPath ./path/to/project/.user-flowrc.json`

### [`collect` command](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/command-collect.md)

Run command over:  
`@npx @push-based/user-flow collect [options]`  or `@npx @push-based/user-flow [options]` as it is the default command.  

Description:  
This command executes a set of user-flow definitions against the target URL and saves the output.

| **`-d`**, **`--dryRun`**           | `boolean` | `false`                | When true the user-flow test will get executed without measures (for fast development)                   |  

> **üí° Pro Tip:**
> CLI arguments that accept multiple values can be set by using the param multiple times in a row:
>
> As an example we could apply two different formats as output for the `collect` command:
> `npx user-flow collect --format=json --format=md`

## Configuration

The CLI supports the official [user-flow/lighthouse configuration](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/master/docs/configuration.md). 

Details on how to work with configurations can be found in the [configuratin section](./packages/cli/docs/lh-configuraton.md).    


# Writing user flows for the CLI

You can think of user flows as front end e2e tests which measures performance related information during the test.

## [Basic user flows](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/writing-basic-user-flows.md)

Write basic user flows leveraging all 3 measurement modes of lighthouse.


**User flow measurement modes**

| Icon  | Mode       | Measure            | Performance  | Accessibility | Best Practices | SEO       | PWA       |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------ | ------------- | -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| ![user-flow_navigation-icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10064416/165129388-2f62bb82-4856-456c-a513-ae5607cfe4ea.PNG) | Navigation | Page load          | 100% / 30    | 100% / 30     | 100% / 30      | 100% / 30 | ‚úî / 7 |
| ![user-flow_timespan-icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10064416/165129495-330ddca5-fd8b-4ecc-a839-477302f7f229.PNG) | Timespan   | User Interaction   |  10  / 10    |       ‚ùå      |   7  /  7      |     ‚ùå    |     ‚ùå    |
| ![user-flow_snapshot-icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10064416/165129696-68302177-6c7d-4aa2-ba3c-564939cde228.PNG) | Snapshot   | Current page state |   4  /  4    |  16  / 16     |   5  /  5      |   9  /  9 |     ‚ùå    |

When you execute and open the user-flow report you will see the measurement modes also visualized there.

## [Advanced architecture](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/ufo-architecture.md)

Organizing testing logic is an art. If you don't own that knowledge, the amount of low-level code get's a night mare to maintain in bigger projects...

**This is the reason we introduced UFO's!**
**Organize clutter code üëΩ in developer friendly shells üõ∏**

![user-flow--advanced-architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10064416/208248762-504897a3-3ef5-42dc-8060-70cda0ad682f.PNG)

See [ufo-architecture](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/ufo-architecture.md) for more details.

## [Working with DevTools Recorder exports](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/recorder-exports.md)

Chrome DevTools provides a feature to help with record and export user interactions. 
This can replace any handwritten code and organizes interactions in a JSON structure.
![user-flow--replay-scripts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10064416/208249076-744bc6be-aa03-42f7-b209-c815c2f90ca2.PNG)

This library provides a way to replay and enrich those interactions over the CLI.

See [recorder-exports](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/recorder-exports.md) for more details.

## [Performance Budgets](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/performance-budgets.md)

Implementing performance improvements without breaking something is hard.  
**Even harder is it, to keep it that way. üîí**

![img-budgets-mode-support](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10064416/164581870-3534f8b0-b7c1-4252-9f44-f07febaa7359.PNG)

See [performance-budgets](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/performance-budgets.md) for more details.

## [GitHub workflow integration of lighthouse user flows in your PR](https://github.com/push-based/user-flow/blob/main/packages/cli/docs/github-workflow-integration.md)

With just a few steps you can run your user flows in as a GitHub workflow to enrich your PR's with report summaries as comments.

Automatically create a workflow with:  
`npx user-flow init --generateGhWorkflow`  

![user-flow-gh-action-cover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10064416/216605948-b8fffdda-3459-48c9-975a-75ec95544d30.png)
